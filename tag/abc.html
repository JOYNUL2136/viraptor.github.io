</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I started playing some flash-based <span class="caps">MMORPG</span> for fun lately. The limited
options available to the characters in RPGs are not as entertaining as
programming, so this didn&#8217;t last long; but it definitely gave me an
idea&#8230; Can I get the event stream and decode it without knowing
anything about the game&#8217;s design and of course without any source
available? Now that&#8217;s an interesting&nbsp;quest!</p>
<p>Warning: if you see anything silly about <span class="caps">ABC</span> or Flash, that might be
because I learned everything I know about it during this project. Any
corrections&nbsp;welcome.</p>
<p><strong>Overview of&nbsp;communication</strong></p>
<p>Before going into the details of communication I had to figure out
what&#8217;s happening in general - what connections are started, how much
data is sent, what does the encapsulation look like, etc. That task is
pretty trivial with help of Wireshark. I set it to capture everything,
connected, entered the game for a moment and left. So what could I learn
from this short&nbsp;record?</p>
<p>There were three communication&nbsp;channels:</p>
<ul>
<li>An unencrypted <span class="caps">HTTP</span> <span class="caps">GET</span> request which returned one word (number) -
    probably something related to a version check or cache&nbsp;invalidation</li>
<li>An encrypted <span class="caps">HTTP</span> request which contained (thanks to <span class="caps">SSL</span> <span class="caps">MITM</span> and
    own <span class="caps">CA</span> injection) the first login and some details about the
    available game&nbsp;characters</li>
<li>Then some time later, a single <span class="caps">TCP</span> connection constantly streaming
    loads of small portions of&nbsp;data</li>
</ul>
<p>Everything looks pretty obvious, but&#8230; the long <span class="caps">TCP</span> connection seems to
contain just garbage. That usually means that the data is either
compressed or encrypted. The second one being more likely since that
game would aim for minimum delays and small update packets. After
checking the usual options - can &#8216;file&#8217; identify the stream, does it
start with any standard header, can standard tools unpack it, does it
contain any readable strings - I found that the only answer was &#8220;no&#8221;.
Encryption it is&nbsp;then&#8230;</p>
<p><strong>Going&nbsp;deeper</strong></p>
<p>Finding out more details about encryption was pretty easy. I
disassembled the code in .swf and noticed that even though the main code
was obfuscated, the libraries weren&#8217;t. This only required a quick grep
for &#8220;cipher&#8221; and I knew the library was from crypto.hurlant.com. After a
moment it was obvious which function to look for (Crypto.getCipher).
This was very useful, because at that point I knew both what functions
were used and what arguments they take. Calls to that function were
present in a couple of places as expected and what was left was to
figure out where does the key come from. That part was a bit&nbsp;harder.</p>
<p><strong>Flash decompilers are very poor&nbsp;quality</strong></p>
<p>I tried to find some decompiler for Flash to find the source of the key
generation. Browsing through the <span class="caps">ABC</span> was a bit too hard (even though
<a href="http://www.adobe.com/content/dam/Adobe/en/devnet/actionscript/articles/avm2overview.pdf" title="AVM 2 Overview">the code</a>
itself is quite simple) and I could not know how far the answer was.
Maybe the key was generated in a trivial function, maybe it was split
over many&nbsp;stages&#8230;</p>
<p>I thought: why not decompile everything to <span class="caps">AS</span> source code, surely it
can&#8217;t be that tricky. Unfortunately it was - I got 3 different results
from the software I could get my hands on: Complete crash, crash only on
some modules, refusing to decompile. To be honest, I did not expect
<a href="http://www.hex-rays.com/" title="Hex Rays homepage">hexrays</a> quality but
something that does the minimum would be great. The partial results I
got were completely silly and quite surprising. It seems that the easily
available flash decompilers don&#8217;t even try to recreate what the code
does - they just switch instructions into <span class="caps">AS</span> statements. If your <span class="caps">ABC</span>
says &#8220;inclocal_i &#8230;; declocal_i &#8230;&#8221; that&#8217;s exactly what you&#8217;ll see
done on a temporary variable&#8230; which turns out to be unused&nbsp;afterwards.</p>
<p>At this point I&#8217;ve done what any other insane person would do - started
writing own decompiler. It&#8217;s not that hard really. Actually you can grab
the last compiler you wrote (everyone wrote one, right?), and reuse
large parts of it. Operations gets split into blocks linked to other
blocks, you name every stack position and local variable with unique
name, convert the code into <span class="caps">SSA</span> form, remove dead blocks, do peep-hole
optimisations to strip silly obfuscation code, detect which loops can be
converted into while-s/for-s and spit out the code&#8230; At stage 3 or 4, I
noticed that the whole idea is silly and although the project was
working nicely (probably at this point gave better results than some
commercial solutions I tried before, even if not all opcodes were
implemented) this is just wasting time. I had one simple task and this
tool would take too long to complete even if it was limited to just <span class="caps">ABC</span>
cleanup and propagating argument names into&nbsp;variables.</p>
<p><strong>A better&nbsp;way</strong></p>
<p>Since I didn&#8217;t really care about where the password comes from, but only
what it is, I decided to do something else&#8230; print out the key itself.
Apparently there&#8217;s this thing called flash debug player and you can use
it to see the output of all &#8220;trace(&#8230;)&#8221; calls with it - awesome! Ah&#8230;
and you need a 32b windows system for it, otherwise it&#8217;s not going to
work - that was a bit painful, but virtualbox solved this problem quite&nbsp;well.</p>
<p>What I needed to do was to inject a bit of custom own code into the
existing .swf, run it under the debug version of flash and collect the
result. Injecting the code seems pretty hard if you want to do it
yourself. There are loads of projects which will disassemble the .swf
file, but almost none which can reassemble it again. Fortunately
<a href="http://code.google.com/p/apparat/" title="Apparat project homepage">Apparat</a>
does this in a quite simple way - by providing an <span class="caps">API</span> written in Scala.
It provides a complete, magical framework for modifying the code and the
only thing you need to provide is a filter to choose where the
modification should be applied and a new template to expand in that&nbsp;place.</p>
<p>Locating the needed part was pretty easy. It looked something like&nbsp;this:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>getlocal 1
getlocal 2
getlocal 3
call_property getCipher, 3
</pre></div>


<p>This means just &#8220;load 3 local variables on the stack and call
getCipher&#8221;. Of course the parameters were known from the library&nbsp;source:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>getCipher(name:String, key:ByteArray, pad:IPad=null):ICipher
</pre></div>


<p>I was interested in the key and the cipher. The pad was not needed after
all - because the cipher turned out to be &#8220;rc4&#8221;. The way it works
(simplified) is similar to a combination of a known seed (the key), a
pseudo-random number generator and the plaintext xor&#8217;ed with the <span class="caps">PRNG</span>&#8217;s
output. Very simple design and there are lots of libraries available to
verify the&nbsp;result.</p>
<p>Because only two arguments were interesting, it meant inserting the call
to &#8220;trace&#8221; somewhere before the call to the library can give me the
needed data. The only thing to remember is that the stack needs to be
returned to exactly the same state as before, otherwise the rest of the
code would fail. None of the local variables can be overwritten either.
This is a work for a spy: get the key, convert to string, print out, put
everything back in its place. Here&#8217;s the full filter for Apparat,
printing out the second&nbsp;parameter:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">private</span> <span class="nf">lazy</span> <span class="nx">val</span> <span class="n">traceCipherCall</span><span class="o"> =</span> <span class="p">{</span>

  <span class="p">})</span> <span class="p">^^</span> <span class="p">{</span>
    <span class="k">case</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">GetLocal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">~</span> <span class="nx">GetLocal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">~</span> <span class="nx">GetLocal</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="err">~</span> <span class="nx">x</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="o">=&gt;</span> <span class="kt">List</span><span class="err">[</span><span class="nx">AbstractOp</span><span class="cp">]</span><span class="x">(</span>
<span class="x">      FindPropStrict(traceQName),</span>
<span class="x">      GetLocal(2),</span>
<span class="x">      ConvertString(),</span>
<span class="x">      CallPropVoid(traceQName, 1),</span>
<span class="x">      GetLocal(1),</span>
<span class="x">      GetLocal(2),</span>
<span class="x">      GetLocal(3),</span>
<span class="x">      x)</span>
<span class="x">    case _ =&gt; error(&quot;internal fail&quot;)</span>
<span class="x">  }</span>
<span class="x">}</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This is fairly simple - match 3 getlocal-s followed by a call to
&#8220;getCipher&#8221;. This sequence is pretty specific, so it matched only in 2
places - exactly where it was needed. Now I needed to get the output.
One installation of windows + debug flash + tons of crap later, I
discovered that&#8230; the application detects whether it&#8217;s running in a
debugging environment and changes its configuration to use the test
server&nbsp;instead.</p>
<p><strong>Removing debugger&nbsp;detection</strong></p>
<p>Two google searches later I found that the most likely way of debugger
detection is checking the &#8220;isDebugger&#8221; variable. Unfortunately the check
wasn&#8217;t done in a simple if/else way. The code pushed the &#8220;isDebugger&#8221;
string to some other function which then saved the results of the number
of checks. I really didn&#8217;t want to get into the details of how that
happens. The easiest alternative was to use some other flag which was
guaranteed to be false. Luckily, &#8220;avHardwareDisable&#8221; turned out to be a
good candidate. The modification was quickly applied&#8230; and the app went
into testing mode again. Something else was missing - the most trivial
fix was not&nbsp;enough.</p>
<p>The second simplest thing to try was to look for the string describing
the testing server and browse the code around it for some condition
checking. And it was there! Some function was doing what looked like a
dns lookup (still not sure if that was the case) and comparing the
result to a known value - apparently running in a debugger influenced
the result somehow. Since adding the &#8220;testing&#8221; string depended on the
result of this function, it was a good enough candidate for patching.
Fortunately the following&nbsp;sequence:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>  convert_string
  equals
  getlocal_2
  if_true &quot;L2&quot;
  not
&quot;L2:&quot;
  return_value
</pre></div>


<p>is not that popular. What happens here is: two strings get compared
first, then the result gets flipped if local_2 is not set, then the
result is returned. It&#8217;s basically returning the result of string
comparison xor local_2 - probably it went through bytecode obfuscation.
The good way to hardcode the result without messing up the stack was
changing the beginning&nbsp;to:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>poppush_false
push_true
</pre></div>


<p>And&#8230; success! On the next try the application connected to a
production server and printed out the key it used. Not only that, but
the key was successfully used later on to read and write any of the
events sent between the client and the server. But that&#8217;s a topic for
another post in the&nbsp;future.</p>
<p>Lessons if you want to protect your&nbsp;communication:</p>
<ul>
<li>obfuscate the object files after including the libraries, not
    before - especially if the libraries are&nbsp;open-source</li>
<li>do a random key exchange instead of hardcoding your&nbsp;passphrase</li>
<li>add <span class="caps">CA</span> verification (is it possible in flash? not&nbsp;sure)</li>
<li>disassemble your own binaries to find&nbsp;issues</li>
<li>&#8230; all of the above will be worked around and your app will be
    hacked anyway, get used to the idea&nbsp;:)</li>
