</footer><!-- /.post-info --><p>I&#8217;ve got a couple of Linux machines that need a transparent backup
solution at home. Transparent as in - they should happen all the time,
without asking, without notification, without any interaction. Ideally
it shouldn&#8217;t run on the client either just to avoid issues with system
updates. Making it all server-side allows me also to backup my
girlfriend&#8217;s machine without explaining the setup - which is great when
even periodic upgrades are a pain to&nbsp;enforce.</p>
<p>Another couple of requirements I had&nbsp;were:</p>
<ul>
<li>backing up in local network (I don&#8217;t have enough bandwidth to backup
    remotely all the&nbsp;time)</li>
<li>saving storage space where files don&#8217;t&nbsp;change</li>
<li>able to run on a small device (I&#8217;ve got a
    <a href="http://www.tonidoplug.com/">TonidoPlug</a>&nbsp;ready)</li>
<li>directory-based rather than fs-based (I&#8217;ve got a number of VMs I
    really don&#8217;t want to waste time backing&nbsp;up)</li>
</ul>
<p>Unfortunately there aren&#8217;t many good, ready solutions and there aren&#8217;t
many choices in general either. Most solutions fall into one of the
following groups: trivial copy, archiving solutions, rsync-like and
full-blown&nbsp;systems.</p>
<p>To be honest, maybe a big system like bacula can do what I need&#8230; but
with it having more components that I have local hosts, I didn&#8217;t want to
invest that much time in learning the&nbsp;configuration.</p>
<p>At small companies where I set up backups, I was happy with <span class="caps">DAR</span>. Full
backups split into volumes of a given size and stored on removable disks
weekly, with daily diffs stored locally - perfect. Here it won&#8217;t work -
I can&#8217;t saturate the network or disk io every couple of hours. I really
don&#8217;t want to deal with replacing removable disks. Some more intelligent
solution is&nbsp;required.</p>
<h3>Enter&nbsp;rsnapshot</h3>
<p><a href="http://www.rsnapshot.org/">Rsnapshot</a> is an interesting mix between
systems that understand backup schedules and a minimal backup utility.
Rsnapshot can copy files from a remote host using rsync (and ssh for
example). Then, it knows how to hard-link files that didn&#8217;t change to
avoid wasting both bandwidth and storage. It also knows how to rotate
backup directories when new backups come in and how to promote backups
between&nbsp;levels.</p>
<p>The schedule and promotion is done in a very simple way too. Since
rsnapshot needs to be run from some scheduler like cron, it takes the
name of the backup as a parameter. This can be for example &#8220;daily&#8221;,
&#8220;weekly&#8221;, &#8220;purple&#8221;, or whatever you want to call it. What&#8217;s important is
the order in rsnapshot config file - only the first entry will get
copied from source, others will get promoted from the &#8220;upper&#8221; level&nbsp;locally.</p>
<p>This is pretty much exactly what was needed. For the remote copy, ssh
can be configured to use a password-less key to authenticate on the
remote hosts. In case it&#8217;s possible to access the backup server from the
internet, making sure it <a href="http://technokracy.net/2011/01/07/root_sudo_rsnapshot/">can run only
rsync</a> is a good
idea too. For paranoid people, this can be also locked down with
apparmor or selinux to deny anything apart from read-only&nbsp;access.</p>
<h3>Sample&nbsp;configuration</h3>
<p>So what does this look like in&nbsp;practice?</p>
<p>The server which collects the backups has rsnapshot and rsync installed.
It also has a password-less ssh key created: just run <em>ssh-keygen</em> and
copy the resulting <em>id_rsa.pub</em> into client machine&#8217;s
<em>\~/.ssh/authorized_keys</em>.</p>
<p>It also has a separate partition available for each backup. In my case
they&#8217;re mounted under <em>/media/disk1partX</em>.</p>
<p>Now, each machine which needs backing up requires a configuration file.
I put them all in my plug&#8217;s root directory:
<em>/root/rsnapshot_configs/xxx.</em> Each machine looks almost the same. For
example host <em>walker</em> has <em>/root/rsnapshot_configs/walker</em>:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>config_version    1.2
snapshot_root    /media/disk1part2/rsnapshot

cmd_rsync    /usr/bin/rsync
cmd_ssh    /usr/bin/ssh
cmd_du    /usr/bin/du
exclude_file    /root/rsnapshot_configs/walker.exclude

retain    hourly    5
retain    daily    7
retain    weekly    5

backup    viraptor@walker.local:/home/viraptor    viraptor
</pre></div>


<p>This configuration says that <em>/media/disk1part2/rsnapshot/viraptor</em> will
keep copies of <em>/home/viraptor</em> (minus some excludes like <em>.cache</em>,
<em>.steam</em>, etc.) - 5 hourly ones, then 7 daily ones, then 5 weekly ones.
All files which have not changed will be hard-linked and no space will
be wasted on exact duplicates. The backup is taken from the host
walker.local (thanks <a href="http://avahi.org/">Avahi</a>!).</p>
<p>But that&#8217;s only the definition of what&#8230; what about when? Crontab
entries are what actually triggers the rsnapshot actions and they live
in <em>/etc/cron.d</em>. The content&nbsp;is:</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre>55 */2 * * * root (/bin/ping -c1 walker.local &gt;/dev/null 2&gt;/dev/null) &amp;&amp;
    /usr/bin/rsnapshot -c /root/rsnapshot_configs/walker hourly
20 3 * * * root /usr/bin/rsnapshot -c /root/rsnapshot_configs/walker daily
20 4 * * 1 root /usr/bin/rsnapshot -c /root/rsnapshot_configs/walker weekly
</pre></div>


<p>This means that every 2 hours if the host is on (it most likely isn&#8217;t),
rsnapshot will take another hourly copy. Then every day in the morning
it will promote an old hourly snapshot to daily and once a week it will
promote daily to&nbsp;weekly.</p>
<h3>Summary</h3>
<p>All simple and easy. There&#8217;s no specific recovery procedure involved,
because all backups are available as normal files on the server. It&#8217;s
actually easy to browse the old entries in case only one or two files
need recovering. And in case of serious issues - just rsync everything
back from the last snapshot. So far I&#8217;m very happy with&nbsp;it.</p>
<p>One thing to watch out for is the exclusions file in case you don&#8217;t have
a massive harddrive available. If you happen to install Steam with some
games you may start getting emails about failed backups&#8230; but there&#8217;s
only so many copies of portal or tf2 that you&#8217;ll need in your life - you
probably don&#8217;t need them in the backups unless you have lots of space.
<span class="caps">VM</span> images which change all the time are also very bad candidates for
backing up with rsnapshot. Every modification there will need a
separate, complete&nbsp;copy.</p>
<p>With a &#8220;normal&#8221; developer-style usage the size of old copies is close to
none. Currently, my last copy is <span class="caps">22GB</span>, but all previous snapshots and
modifications add only <span class="caps">2GB</span> to&nbsp;that.</p>                </article>
